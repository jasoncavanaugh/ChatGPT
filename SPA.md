### What is a single-page application? How is it different from a traditional website?

A single-page application (SPA) is a type of web application that loads a single HTML page and then dynamically updates the page as the user interacts with the application. In contrast to traditional websites, which typically require the browser to request a new HTML page from the server each time the user navigates to a new page, an SPA loads all of its content and functionality within a single page, updating the page dynamically as the user interacts with the application.

There are several key differences between a single-page application and a traditional website:

1. **Page reloads**
   As mentioned earlier, traditional websites require the browser to request a new HTML page from the server each time the user navigates to a new page. In contrast, an SPA does not require the browser to request a new page from the server; instead, it updates the content of the existing page dynamically as the user interacts with the application.

2. **Server communication**
   Traditional websites typically communicate with the server using HTTP requests and responses, with each request resulting in a new HTML page being sent back to the browser. An SPA, on the other hand, communicates with the server using APIs (Application Programming Interfaces), which allow the application to send and receive data from the server without requiring a full page reload.

3. **Performance**
   Because an SPA loads all of its content and functionality within a single page, it can be faster and more responsive than a traditional website, which requires the browser to request and receive new HTML pages from the server each time the user navigates to a new page.

4. **Development**
   Single-page applications are typically developed using JavaScript frameworks, such as React or Angular, which provide a set of tools and libraries for building dynamic, interactive web applications. Traditional websites are often developed using a mix of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, but do not typically use these types of frameworks.

Overall, a single-page application is a type of web application that loads all of its content and functionality within a single page, updating the page dynamically as the user interacts with the application. It is different from a traditional website in terms of page reloads, server communication, performance, and development.

### If in a traditional website, I make a separate request to the web server for each page that I navigate to, how does routing happen in a SPA? If the web server only ships a single HTML page and then that page is dynamically updated on the client via JavaScript, why do most SPAs still change the URL for each page that you visit? It's all just one page, no?

In a single-page application (SPA), routing refers to the process of mapping different URL paths to different views or pages within the application. When the user navigates to a different view within the SPA, the URL in the browser's address bar is updated to reflect the current view, but the page is not reloaded from the server.

Even though a single-page application only loads a single HTML page, it can use JavaScript to dynamically update the content of that page as the user navigates through the application. This allows the SPA to behave like a traditional website, with different views or pages that can be accessed by navigating to different URL paths.

One reason why SPAs still change the URL for each page that the user visits is to make it easier for the user to bookmark specific views or pages within the application and to share links to those views with others. It also allows the SPA to use the browser's history API to track the user's navigation within the application, so that the user can use the browser's back and forward buttons to navigate between views.

Another reason is that search engines rely on URLs to discover and index the content of a website. By changing the URL as the user navigates through the SPA, it can be easier for search engines to discover and index the different views or pages within the application.

Overall, in a single-page application, routing refers to the process of mapping different URL paths to different views or pages within the application, and changing the URL as the user navigates through the application can make it easier for the user to bookmark specific views, share links to those views, and allow search engines to discover and index the content of the application.

### Is there a name for this kind of routing?

Yes, this type of routing is often referred to as client-side routing or front-end routing.

In client-side routing, the routing logic is implemented on the client side, using JavaScript and the browser's history API. When the user navigates to a different view or page within the application, the URL in the browser's address bar is updated to reflect the current view, but the page is not reloaded from the server. Instead, the SPA uses JavaScript to dynamically update the content of the page as the user navigates through the application.

Client-side routing is often used in single-page applications (SPAs), which are web applications that load a single HTML page and then dynamically update the page as the user interacts with the application. It allows the SPA to behave like a traditional website, with different views or pages that can be accessed by navigating to different URL paths, while still providing the performance benefits of a single-page application.

I hope this helps to clarify things further. If you have any other questions, don't hesitate to ask.

### What is the opposite of client-side routing?

The opposite of client-side routing is server-side routing.

In server-side routing, the routing logic is implemented on the server side, using the server's programming language and framework. When the user navigates to a different view or page within the application, the server receives the request and sends back a new HTML page with the updated content. This results in a full page reload each time the user navigates to a different view or page within the application.

Server-side routing is often used in traditional websites, which are web applications that consist of a collection of separate HTML pages that are requested and served by the server as the user navigates through the application. It allows the application to provide different views or pages that can be accessed by navigating to different URL paths, but it can result in a slower and less responsive user experience compared to a single-page application (SPA) that uses client-side routing.

Overall, server-side routing is the opposite of client-side routing in that it involves implementing the routing logic on the server side and sending back a new HTML page each time the user navigates to a different view or page within the application.

### Are these the only two kinds of routing?

Client-side routing and server-side routing are the two main types of routing used in web applications. However, it's important to note that there are other ways to implement routing as well.

One example is hybrid routing, which combines elements of both client-side and server-side routing. In a hybrid routing approach, the initial HTML page is loaded from the server, and subsequent route changes are handled on the client side using JavaScript and the browser's history API. This can allow the application to provide a faster and more responsive user experience while still allowing search engines to discover and index the different views or pages within the application.

Another example is serverless routing, which is a type of client-side routing that is implemented using a serverless architecture. In a serverless routing approach, the initial HTML page is loaded from a static file host (such as Amazon S3 or Google Cloud Storage), and subsequent route changes are handled on the client side using JavaScript and the browser's history API. This can allow the application to be highly scalable and cost-effective, but it can also be more challenging to implement and maintain compared to a traditional server-side or client-side routing approach.

Overall, while client-side routing and server-side routing are the two main types of routing used in web applications, there are other approaches as well, such as hybrid routing and serverless routing, which can offer different trade-offs in terms of performance, scalability, and complexity.

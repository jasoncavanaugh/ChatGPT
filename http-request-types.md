### What are all the different HTTP methods?

HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is a protocol that is used to facilitate communication between clients and servers on the internet.
HTTP defines a set of methods, or verbs, that can be used to indicate the desired action to be performed on a specified resource.
Here is a list of the most commonly used HTTP methods:

1. **GET** - The GET method is used to retrieve a representation of a resource. When a client sends a GET request to a server, it is requesting that the server send back the contents of the resource. This is the most common HTTP method and is used to retrieve web pages, images, and other resources from a server.

2. **HEAD** - The HEAD method is similar to the GET method, but it does not request the contents of the resource. Instead, it only requests the HTTP headers, which contain metadata about the resource, such as its content type and size. The HEAD method is often used to check the status of a resource or to see if it has been modified.

3. **POST** - The POST method is used to submit an entity to a resource, often causing a change in state or side effects on the server. For example, a POST request might be used to submit a form to a server, which would then create a new resource or update an existing one.

4. **PUT** - The PUT method is used to replace a representation of a resource with a new one. When a client sends a PUT request to a server, it is requesting that the server update the resource with the new representation.

5. **DELETE** - The DELETE method is used to delete a resource. When a client sends a DELETE request to a server, it is requesting that the server delete the specified resource.

6. **CONNECT** - The CONNECT method is used to establish a tunnel to the server identified by the target resource.

7. **OPTIONS** - The OPTIONS method is used to describe the communication options for the target resource.

8. **TRACE** - The TRACE method is used to perform a message loop-back test along the path to the target resource.

9. **PATCH** - The PATCH method is used to apply partial modifications to a resource.

There are also a few additional HTTP methods that are less commonly used:

10. **COPY** - The COPY method is used to create a copy of a resource.

11. **LOCK** - The LOCK method is used to apply a lock to a resource.

12. **UNLOCK** - The UNLOCK method is used to remove a lock from a resource.

These HTTP methods are defined in the HTTP specification and are used to indicate the desired action to be performed on a specified resource. They are a fundamental part of how the internet works and are used by clients to communicate with servers in order to access and manipulate resources.
